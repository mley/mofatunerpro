# MofaTunerPro

Arduino + Android project for my brother's race bike. The arduino reads throttle position, RPM and lambda value and 
transmits this data via bluetooth to the android app. The app displays and logs the data. The data shall give advice 
how to setup the carburetor for optimal performance.
