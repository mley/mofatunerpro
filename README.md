# MofaTunerPro

Arduino + Android project for my brother's race bike. The arduino reads throttle 
position, RPM and lambda value and transmits this data via bluetooth to the 
android app. The app displays and logs the data. The data shall give advice how 
to setup the carburetor for optimal performance.

Work in progress. Photos, schematics coming soon.
